Airbnb Berlin Data Transformation Project
Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a data transformation and modeling solution using Airbnb data from Berlin. The goal was to leverage dbt (Data Build Tool) for data transformation, ensuring high-quality and consistent data, while using Snowflake as the data warehouse for efficient storage and processing.

Objectives
Transform raw Airbnb data into structured, analysis-ready datasets.
Ensure data consistency, accuracy, and scalability.
Automate the data extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) process.
Utilize dbt and Snowflake to create a robust data pipeline.
Technologies Used
dbt (Data Build Tool): To manage and automate the transformation of Airbnb data.
Snowflake: Cloud-based data warehouse for efficient storage and retrieval.
SQL: Used for querying and data modeling.
PostgreSQL: Utilized for structuring and managing the data.

Key Features
Data Modeling: Modular SQL models were developed using dbt, converting raw Airbnb data into structured, analysis-ready datasets.
Automated Data Pipelines: By integrating dbt with Snowflake, the data pipeline was fully automated, eliminating manual steps and ensuring scalability.
Data Quality Testing: Incorporated data quality checks and tests in dbt to ensure accuracy and consistency of the transformed data.
